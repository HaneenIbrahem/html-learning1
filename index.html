<p>Hello everyone. My name is Haneen Ibrahem. I studied Computer Engineering at An-Najah National University, where I developed a passion for software development, networking, and system architecture. During my training in Quality Assurance at Gaza Sky Geeks, I honed my skills in software testing, defect tracking, and quality management. I am currently studying the subject of DevOps to enhance my knowledge of software development methodologies and streamline the deployment process. I plan to complete it within 3-4 months as part of my ongoing professional development. I am particularly interested in exploring automation, continuous integration, and cloud technologies in the context of DevOps practices. In the future, I aspire to pursue a career where I can leverage my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to innovative technology projects and initiatives.</p>
